How it started: 

How it's going:

Hello, and welcome to my README! This is for my Week 2 Challenge, which was to create a personal portfolio website. I learned a lot while doing this, and I am happy to be able to share my experience with you. 

It was my job to ensure my portfolio website had the following capabilities: 

	- includes: my name, a photo of me, links and information about me

	- links that, when clicked, scroll to the corresponding section

    -titled images of all my previous work (and placeholder images) with different sizes. When clicked these images will take the user to the deployed application (or an error page!)

	- a responsive layout that adapts to different screen sizes

<br>

I was to create this portfolio, and meet all of the requirements listed above, by using: 

	- HTML
    - CSS 
       - flexbox
       - CSS grid
       - media queries 
       - CSS variables
    - bonus: 
       - pseudo-elements
       - pseudo-classes 
	
I am working on this project because a portfolio website with examples of my work will be extremely important in securing possible employment.

It is important that I am able to showcase what I can do in an interactive and meaningful way.

## Installation

There is no installation required. All files must remain in the position in which they are saved to ensure that all links, styles and photos function properly. 

Below are examples of the links for the CSS style sheet and the images used in this webpage.

## Usage 

In the gif included below, I have demonstrated how all of the navigation links work. When the links in the navigation bar are clicked, they will jump to the corresponding section in the webpage, or open up a seperate webpage.

## Credits
These are some sources I used to help me along:

- [emojipedia.org](https://emojipedia.org/)

- [CSS Grid Layout](https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_grid.asp)

- [Responsive Web Design](https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_rwd_intro.asp)

- [CSS Flexbox](https://www.w3schools.com/css/css3_flexbox.asp)

## Learning
Here are the highlights of what I learned and issues I had while writing this code.

1. It took me FOREVER to understand flexbox containers and items, and what properties can be assigned to each. I may have bitten off more than I could chew at the beginning and made things needlessly complicated for myself. I feel like I have a much better understanding of how flexboxes work now.

2. It took me LONGER THAN FOREVER to understand CSS Grid Layout. I am a very visual person, and trying to understand the grid layout just in my head was extremely confusing and led to a lot of frustration. I will always be drawing out my grids from now on. 

3. Using pseudo elements and classes is a lot of fun. It's like an extra level of customization outside of the regular customization of CSS. 

4. How important divs are and making sure that you have everything in the proper containers.

Below are some images of the drawings I did when planning my portfolio out. Quite a few things changed from my original ideas, but I found the drawings extremely helpful in planning out my HTML and CSS.
